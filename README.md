# SU2 Docker container
This repository contains a [user guide](LATEX/main.pdf) for installing and running a Docker container on Windows. The container itself can also be run on Linux (tested) and on macOS, altough the guide only shows the procedure for a Windows system. The container is based on ubuntu 23.04 and runs SU2 version 8 compiled with openMPI, mixed precision for linear algebra computations, no OMP parallelism, and no discrete/continuous adjoint.
